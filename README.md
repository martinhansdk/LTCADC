LTCADC
======

An Arduino library for Linear Technology ADCs. The library currently supports the LTC2439-1, but is designed 
to be extensible to support other Analog digital converters that use the same SPI protocol. Pull requests are
very welcome.

The library is loosely based on the ADC library by Jan Dalheimer, see https://sites.google.com/site/alternativarduino/english/librarys/adc
